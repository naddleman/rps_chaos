### Chaotic solutions in evolutionary game theory

This code supplements a paper on a pair of agents/populations playing 
rock-paper-scissors and updating their strategies by the replicator dynamics.

The twist is that the populations play against themselves at the same time
as they play against one another. This peculiar evolutionary dynamics results
in chaotic solutions for some payoff choices.
